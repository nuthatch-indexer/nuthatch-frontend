# Nuthatch installer.
#
# Downloads the prebuilt static binary for your platform from the latest GitHub release, verifies
# its SHA-256 checksum, and installs it. No compiler needed - you never build from source, so the
# rustc toolchain on your machine is irrelevant.
#
# It is deliberately short and readable. Piping a script to a shell asks for trust; read it first.
#   Source: https://github.com/nuthatch-indexer/nuthatch
#   Override install dir with NUTHATCH_INSTALL_DIR (default: $HOME/.local/bin).
