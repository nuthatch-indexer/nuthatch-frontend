Every nest `init` scaffolds includes an `llms.txt` — a one-page, plain-text index of the project
written for coding agents. An agent that lands in the directory (or fetches the file from a served
nest) learns in one read what this thing is, what data it holds, and how to query it — without
crawling the source.

## What's in it

Generated from the decode registry — the same source of truth behind `schema.json`, `/tables`, and
the MCP `schema` tool — it contains:

- **What this is**: a self-hosted blockchain index on `<chain>`; query it locally, there is no
  third-party API.
- **The contracts**: every alias and address the nest indexes.
- **The tables**: one line per `{alias}__{event}` table with its columns.
- **The live HTTP API**: the handful of endpoints that matter (`/`, `/tables`,
  `/table/{name}`, `/entity/{id}`, `/sql?q=…`, `/balances`, `/balance/{address}`).
- **The MCP pointer**: run `nuthatch mcp` for the [tool surface](/docs/reference/mcp/), fully
  offline.

## Lifecycle

- **Generated, not authored.** `init` and `add` both write it; `nuthatch schema` regenerates it
  (with `schema.json` and the `semantic.toml` footguns) after you hand-edit the config. Don't
  maintain it by hand — it always reflects the tables the config actually produces.
- **Pinned in the bundle.** A nest's `llms.txt` is part of its content-addressed inputs, so a
  published nest carries its own agent documentation, verified by hash like everything else in
  [the registry](/docs/operate/registry/).

Alongside `llms.txt`, `init` also scaffolds a per-nest `.claude/skills/nuthatch` querying skill —
the deeper counterpart for agents that support skills. The distinction from
[the builder skill](/docs/ai/builder-skill/): the scaffolded skill teaches an agent to *query this
nest*; the builder skill teaches an agent to *drive nuthatch*.
