One SQL surface spans both stores: the live unsealed tip (redb) and the sealed Parquet history,
unioned as DuckDB views. You never think about the seam — a query over `usdc__transfer` sees every
row from deployment to the block indexed a moment ago. Reach it via `nuthatch sql` (a REPL when
called with no query), `GET /sql`, or the MCP `sql` tool.

## Naming

- Every decoded event is a view named **`{alias}__{event}`** in snake_case: `usdc__transfer`,
  `staking__stake_delegated`. `.tables` in the REPL (or `GET /tables`) lists them.
- Factory children share their template's tables (`{template}__{event}`), distinguished by
  `address`.
- [Authored views](/docs/build/views/) and [recipe](/docs/build/recipes/) derivations appear as
  ordinary views alongside the event tables, described in `/schema` like everything else.

## Columns

Every event table carries the implicit columns `block_number`, `block_timestamp`, `log_index`,
`tx_hash`, and `address` (the emitting contract), plus one column per event parameter.

Two footguns, both machine-tracked in [`semantic.toml`](/docs/build/semantic/):

- **Reserved words.** Solidity loves `from` and `to`; SQL reserves them. Double-quote:
  `SELECT "from", "to" FROM usdc__transfer`.
- **Big integers.** A `uint256` column like `value` is stored exactly and can't be summed
  directly. Every big-int column gets a derived **`*_dec`** sibling (`value_dec`) for arithmetic:
  `sum(value_dec)`, `value_dec > 1e6`.

Get either wrong and the error comes back with a fix hint derived from the real schema — the
binder knows the nearest table name, the quoting rule, and the `_dec` convention.

## Semantics & guards

- **SELECT/WITH only.** The surface is read-only by construction; the ingest thread is the single
  writer, and queries attach the sealed segments read-only.
- **Deterministic and finality-aware.** Sealed segments are immutable; only the hot tip can change
  under a reorg, and the union converges with it.
- **Guarded:** a 30-second timeout, a row cap, and 2 concurrent analytical queries. A rejection is
  the node protecting itself — narrow the query rather than fighting the guard. Validate cheaply
  first with `explain`.
- **Provenance-stamped.** Results carry the block range and the content-addressed segment hashes
  they were computed from, so a number can be cited against immutable data and re-derived by
  anyone.

```sql
-- the shape of a typical answer
SELECT date_trunc('day', to_timestamp(block_timestamp)) AS day,
       count(*)                                          AS transfers,
       sum(value_dec) / 1e6                              AS volume_usdc
FROM usdc__transfer
WHERE block_number > 20000000
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 DESC LIMIT 30;
```
