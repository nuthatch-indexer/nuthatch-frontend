title: ABIs, events & tables
description: How decoded events become SQL tables — one table per event, with implicit columns.
order: 2

Nuthatch is a log indexer: it turns a contract's **events** into **SQL tables**. This page explains the
mapping.

## ABIs

At `init`, nuthatch resolves the contract's ABI — **Sourcify first, then an Etherscan-class API** — and
**vendors it** into `abis/`. From then on the ABI is a local file; nuthatch never re-fetches it at
runtime. A `DecodeRegistry` is built from the vendored ABIs at startup: `topic0` → event decoder,
filtered by contract address.

If a contract is a proxy, point `init` at the implementation ABI with `--abi-from <impl-address>`, or
edit the `abi` path in `nuthatch.toml`.

## One table per event

Every declared event becomes a table named `{alias}__{event_snake_case}`. For a contract aliased `usdc`
with a `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)` event, you get a table `usdc__transfer` with
columns `from`, `to`, `value`.

## Implicit columns

Every table also carries the same implicit columns, before the event's own fields:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `block_number` | The block the log was in. |
| `block_hash` | The canonical block hash (a reorg checkpoint). |
| `block_timestamp` | The block header timestamp. |
| `tx_hash` | The transaction hash. |
| `log_index` | The log's index within the block. |
| `address` | The emitting contract (distinguishes children sharing a table — see factories). |
| `_seq` | A single monotonic per-row ordering key, derived deterministically from `(block, log_index)`. |

## Column types

Decoded fields keep their Solidity types. Wide integers (`uint256`, and anything over 128 bits) are
stored as canonical big-endian bytes, with a derived `{col}_dec` DECIMAL column for numeric use. A value
over 38 digits exceeds `DECIMAL(38,0)` — cast to `DOUBLE` or `HUGEINT` in SQL when you need arithmetic.
See [The SQL surface](/docs/reference/sql/).

## Regenerating

`schema.json` (the machine-readable list of tables + columns) and the AI surface (`llms.txt`, semantic
footguns) are derived from `nuthatch.toml` + the ABIs. After editing config, regenerate them:

```sh
nuthatch schema
```
