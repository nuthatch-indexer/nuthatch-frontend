title: nuthatch.toml
description: The one config file a nest has — the [nest] header and one or more [[contracts]].
order: 1
---

A nest has exactly one config file: `nuthatch.toml`. `init` generates it from a contract address; you
edit it to add contracts, events, factories, and the optional compliance and webhook stages. Everything
else in a nest (`schema.json`, `llms.txt`) is *derived* from it — regenerate with `nuthatch schema`.

## The shape

```toml
[nest]
name = "usdc"
chain = "mainnet"
chain_id = 1
rpc_urls = ["https://your-rpc", "https://a-fallback-rpc"]

[[contracts]]
alias = "usdc"
address = "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1D19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
start_block = 6082465            # auto-detected at init
abi = "abis/usdc.json"
events = ["Transfer", "Approval"]  # empty = index every event the ABI defines
```

## `[nest]`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The nest's name (used for the served surface and logs). |
| `chain` | The chain name, e.g. `mainnet`, `arbitrum-one`, `base`. |
| `chain_id` | The chain id, e.g. `1`, `42161`, `8453`. |
| `rpc_urls` | RPC endpoints, tried in order with round-robin failover. Point at your own node. |

## `[[contracts]]`

One block per contract. Repeat it to index many contracts in one nest.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `alias` | Short name — the table prefix (`{alias}__{event}`). |
| `address` | The contract address. |
| `start_block` | Deployment block (auto-detected at `init`); omit to backfill from a recent tip offset. |
| `abi` | Path to the vendored ABI, relative to the nest dir. |
| `events` | Optional allowlist of event names to decode. Empty indexes **every** event the ABI defines. |

> The `events` allowlist is how a nest indexing e.g. a token keeps only `Transfer` instead of millions
> of irrelevant rows. An event name here that the ABI doesn't define is a config error, caught when the
> decode registry is built.

## Optional stages

`nuthatch.toml` also carries the optional layers, each documented on its own page:

- `[[templates]]` + `[[factories]]` — index dynamically discovered children. See [Factories](/docs/build/factories/).
- `[screening]` + `[flags]` + `[[alerts]]` — the compliance pack. See [Compliance pack](/docs/build/compliance/).
- `[[webhooks]]` — POST sealed rows to a URL. See [Webhooks](/docs/build/webhooks/).

Absent stages cost nothing — a nest with none of them is a plain, fast log indexer.
