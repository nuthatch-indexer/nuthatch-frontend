title: Compliance pack
description: Optional screening, flags, and alerts — a derive-only stage over decoded transfers.
order: 7

Some nests need more than raw rows: screen addresses against a sanctions list, flag transfers that cross
a threshold, raise an alert when something fires. The **compliance pack** is an optional stage over your
decoded transfers — off by default, deterministic, and, like every optional integration, it costs
nothing when it isn't configured.

> Screening lists are **local, content-addressed snapshots** you fetch and pin — nuthatch never reaches
> for a gated screening service mid-decode. That would break the
> [no-phone-home rule](/docs/concepts/determinism/).

## The shape

```toml
[screening]
lists = ["<list-hash>"]              # content-addressed snapshots from `nuthatch lists fetch`

[flags]                              # singular table — two built-in rules
threshold = "1000000000000"          # flag any single transfer ≥ this (base units, decimal string)
velocity_amount = "5000000000000"    # flag an address whose windowed outbound volume ≥ this
velocity_window = 7200               # window in BLOCKS (≈24h at 12s blocks); default 7200

[[alerts]]
kinds = ["threshold_flag", "sanction_hit"]   # which annotation kinds to deliver
url = "https://your-service/alerts"
```

- **`[screening]`** — screen each transfer's `from`/`to` against pinned list snapshots. A match becomes
  an append-only **`sanction_hit`** annotation, stamped with the list-snapshot version it matched.
  Fetch a list first with `nuthatch lists fetch` (built-in `ofac-sdn`, `eu-consolidated`, or your own
  via `--url`/`--file`).
- **`[flags]`** — two built-in rules, not arbitrary SQL. `threshold` flags any single transfer at or
  above an amount; `velocity` flags an address whose outbound volume over `velocity_window` **blocks**
  reaches `velocity_amount`. Matches become **`threshold_flag`** annotations. Amounts are base units as
  decimal strings; the window is a **block count**, not wall-clock — an honest approximation, since the
  chain has no clock.
- **`[[alerts]]`** — deliver annotations whose `kind` is in `kinds` to a `url`. The only valid kinds are
  `threshold_flag` and `sanction_hit` — they match the emitted annotations exactly.

## Determinism holds

Screening and flags are deterministic derivations over decoded transfers — a list-snapshot match and two
numeric rules, nothing that phones out mid-decode. They're re-executable: the same blocks and the same
list snapshot always produce the same annotations, which is what makes the signed audit pack
(`nuthatch audit replay`) able to re-prove them from scratch. Effectful notification (the alert POST)
happens **after** sealing, never in the decode path — the same rule as webhooks and enrichers (see
[Determinism](/docs/concepts/determinism/)).

## Delivery is durable

Alerts ride the same host-side [webhook](/docs/build/webhooks/) delivery engine: at-least-once, via a
durable outbox, with retries and backoff. A stalled sink never blocks indexing — it only backs up its own
queue (`nuthatch_alert_outbox_depth` in [/metrics](/docs/operate/metrics/)).

## Query the annotations

Flags and hits are ordinary rows. Query the live counts over the HTTP API — `GET /flags?kind=threshold`
or `?kind=velocity` — or the full sealed history in SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sanction_hit ORDER BY block_number DESC LIMIT 20;
```

## Next

- [Webhooks](/docs/build/webhooks/) — the delivery engine alerts share
- [The semantic layer](/docs/build/semantic/) — describe what a flag means
- [nuthatch.toml](/docs/build/config/) — where the stage is configured
