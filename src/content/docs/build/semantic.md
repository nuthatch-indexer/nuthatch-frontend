title: The semantic layer
description: Describe what tables and columns mean, so agents query correctly instead of guessing.
order: 4

A schema tells you a column is named `value` and typed `uint256`. It doesn't tell you that `value` is
denominated in the token's smallest unit, that you have to divide by `10**decimals`, or that `from`
being the zero address means a mint. That knowledge — the **meaning** — is what separates a correct
query from a plausible-looking wrong one.

Nuthatch keeps that meaning in a **semantic layer**: a `semantic.toml` beside the nest, surfaced through
`/schema` and the [MCP server](/docs/ai/mcp/) so a coding agent gets the real story instead of guessing.

## What it captures

- **Table and column descriptions** — plain-English meaning, beyond the type.
- **Units and scaling** — "amounts are in wei; divide by `10**decimals`" — so an agent doesn't hand you
  a number 10¹⁸ too big.
- **Footguns** — the sharp edges: zero-address-means-mint, fee-on-transfer tokens, a `value` that's
  actually shares not assets. Every gotcha that produces a confidently wrong answer.
- **View meanings** — what each [authored view](/docs/build/views/) computes and when to reach for it.

## Why it exists

The whole point of nuthatch's AI surface is that an agent querying your nest should get **real syntax and
real semantics**, not hallucinations. The semantic layer is how. It's the difference between an agent
that writes `SELECT SUM(value) FROM usdc__transfer` and gets a meaningless wei-sum, and one that knows to
scale by decimals and exclude mints.

> This is the same instinct as shipping `llms.txt` and a `.claude/skills/` directory in scaffolded

## Generated, then curated

`init` seeds `semantic.toml` from the ABI — types, obvious units, the decimals footgun for anything that
looks like a token. You curate from there: add the domain knowledge only you have. It's checked and
drift-gated like everything else, so a description that references a dropped column fails
`nuthatch check`.
